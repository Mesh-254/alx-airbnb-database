To continuously monitor and refine database performance for the given queries, we can use SQL commands like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` or `SHOW PROFILE` to analyze query execution plans. Below is a step-by-step approach to monitor and refine the queries:

---

### **1. Analyze Query Execution Plans**

#### **a) INNER JOIN for Bookings and Users**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    Booking.*, 
    User.first_name, 
    User.last_name,
    User.email, 
    User.phone_number  
FROM Booking 
INNER JOIN User ON Booking.user_id = User.user_id;
```

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- **Missing Indexes**: The query involves an `INNER JOIN` between `Booking` and `User` based on `user_id`. If there are no indexes on the `user_id` column in both tables, this can cause a full table scan.
  
**Suggested Changes**:
- Ensure there is an index on the `user_id` column in both the `Booking` and `User` tables to speed up the join operation.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id_booking ON Booking(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id_user ON User(user_id);
```

#### **b) LEFT JOIN for Properties and Reviews**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    Property.*, 
    Review.review_id, 
    Review.rating, 
    Review.comment, 
    Review.created_at AS review_created_at 
FROM Property 
LEFT JOIN Review ON Property.property_id = Review.property_id 
ORDER BY Review.rating DESC;
```

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- **Ordering**: Sorting the results by `Review.rating` can be slow if the `Review` table is large and doesn't have an index on `rating`.
  
**Suggested Changes**:
- Add an index on `Review.property_id` and `Review.rating`.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_property_id_review ON Review(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_rating_review ON Review(rating);
```

#### **c) FULL OUTER JOIN between Users and Bookings**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT User.*, Booking.* 
FROM User 
FULL OUTER JOIN Booking ON User.user_id = Booking.user_id;
```

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: This operation can be slow as it requires combining data from both `User` and `Booking` tables, including all unmatched rows. MySQL does not natively support `FULL OUTER JOIN`, which may force it to simulate the operation using `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`, potentially causing inefficiency.

**Suggested Changes**:
- Consider using `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` separately, or restructure the query to avoid a full outer join unless absolutely necessary. In case you need a full outer join, the query might need optimization at the application level by combining `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` results.

#### **d) Join with Multiple Tables (Bookings, Users, Properties, Payments)**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status AS booking_status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location AS property_location,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount,
    pay.payment_method,
    pay.payment_date
FROM 
    Booking b
JOIN 
    User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN 
    Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN 
    Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- **Multiple Joins**: This query joins four tables (`Booking`, `User`, `Property`, `Payment`). If any of these tables are large and lack proper indexes, it will be slow.
  
**Suggested Changes**:
- Ensure that the `user_id` and `property_id` columns are indexed in the `Booking` table. Also, ensure that `booking_id` is indexed in the `Payment` table.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id_booking ON Booking(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_id_booking ON Booking(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_id_payment ON Payment(booking_id);
```

#### **e) Refactored Query with WHERE Clause**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status AS booking_status,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount,
    pay.payment_method
FROM 
    Booking b
JOIN 
    User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN 
    Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN 
    Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE 
    b.status = 'confirmed'
    AND b.start_date >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- **WHERE Clause Filtering**: The query uses `b.status = 'confirmed'` and `b.start_date >= CURRENT_DATE`. Without indexes on `status` or `start_date`, filtering could be slow.

**Suggested Changes**:
- Add indexes on `status` and `start_date` columns in the `Booking` table.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_status_booking ON Booking(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_start_date_booking ON Booking(start_date);
```

#### **f) Subquery to Find Properties with Average Rating > 4.0**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
    Property.* 
FROM 
    Property 
WHERE 
    (SELECT AVG(Review.rating) 
     FROM Review 
     WHERE Review.property_id = Property.property_id) > 4.0;
```

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- **Subquery Execution**: The subquery is executed for each row in the `Property` table, which could be inefficient for a large number of properties.

**Suggested Changes**:
- Refactor the query to use a `JOIN` with an aggregated result from `Review`.

```sql
SELECT Property.* 
FROM Property 
JOIN (
    SELECT property_id, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating 
    FROM Review 
    GROUP BY property_id
    HAVING avg_rating > 4.0
) AS avg_reviews ON Property.property_id = avg_reviews.property_id;
```

#### **g) Correlated Subquery for Users with More than 3 Bookings**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT User.* 
FROM User 
WHERE 
    (SELECT COUNT(booking_id) 
     FROM Booking 
     WHERE Booking.user_id = User.user_id) > 3;
```

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- **Correlated Subquery**: The subquery is executed for each row in the `User` table, making this query potentially slow for large datasets.

**Suggested Changes**:
- Refactor the query to use `JOIN` and `GROUP BY` to calculate the number of bookings per user.

```sql
SELECT User.* 
FROM User 
JOIN (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(booking_id) AS booking_count 
    FROM Booking 
    GROUP BY user_id
    HAVING booking_count > 3
) AS user_bookings ON User.user_id = user_bookings.user_id;
```

### **2. Implement the Changes**

After implementing the changes (creating indexes and refactoring queries), you should run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the queries again to confirm performance improvements. This will help identify if the queries are using the indexes efficiently.

### **3. Report the Improvements**

- **Before Indexing**: Queries with joins and subqueries on large tables could result in full table scans, causing slow query execution times.
- **After Indexing and Query Refactoring**: Queries that involve joins on indexed columns and refactored subqueries should show reduced query execution times as they now use indexes and avoid costly subquery executions.

These changes should improve query performance, especially with large datasets. You can monitor query performance regularly using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and `SHOW PROFILE` to detect any further bottlenecks.
