# Airbnb Advanced Database Module

## üìã **About the Project**

This project is part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, focusing on advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques. Learners work with a simulated Airbnb database, gaining hands-on experience in writing complex SQL scripts, implementing indexing, and optimizing query performance. These techniques are essential for managing large-scale applications that require high efficiency and scalability.

## üß† **Learning Objectives**

By completing this project, you will:

1. **Master Advanced SQL**  
   Write and execute complex queries involving joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions for advanced data analysis.

2. **Optimize Query Performance**  
   Use tools like `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` to identify inefficiencies and refactor queries for faster execution.

3. **Implement Indexing and Partitioning**  
   Learn how to apply indexing and table partitioning to enhance query performance on large datasets.

4. **Monitor and Refine Performance**  
   Continuously track query execution and database health, and apply schema changes to maintain optimal performance.

5. **Think Like a DBA**  
   Develop a database-first mindset by designing efficient schemas and employing strategic optimizations.

## üöÄ **Key Highlights**

### 1. **Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams**
- Design an **Entity-Relationship (ER)** diagram to model relationships between users, bookings, properties, and reviews in the Airbnb schema.

### 2. **Complex Queries with Joins**
- Use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` to extract meaningful insights from multiple tables.
- Examples:
  - Retrieve bookings with corresponding user details.
  - Show properties and their reviews, including properties without reviews.

### 3. **Power of Subqueries**
- Master both correlated and non-correlated subqueries.
- Examples:
  - Find properties with an average rating above 4.0.
  - Identify users with more than 3 bookings using a correlated subquery.

### 4. **Aggregations and Window Functions**
- Utilize SQL aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG`.
- Employ window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`) to rank and analyze data.

### 5. **Indexing for Optimization**
- Identify high-usage columns in `User`, `Booking`, and `Property` tables.
- Use `CREATE INDEX` to speed up queries involving these columns.
- Analyze performance before and after indexing.

### 6. **Query Optimization Techniques**
- Refactor complex queries to improve execution time.
- Minimize unnecessary operations and leverage indexing effectively.

### 7. **Partitioning Large Tables**
- Partition the **Booking** table by `start_date` to optimize queries on date ranges.
- Test and document performance improvements after partitioning.

### 8. **Performance Monitoring and Schema Refinement**
- Use `SHOW PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to track query performance.
- Propose and implement schema adjustments to resolve bottlenecks.
